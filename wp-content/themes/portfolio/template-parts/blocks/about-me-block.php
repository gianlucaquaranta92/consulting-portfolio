        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I'm Italian, and seven years ago, I moved to the beautiful Sweden with my girlfriend. Now, we have two wonderful kids.

        In 2020, I began my coding journey with a course on Codecademy about HTML+CSS+JS and later, i learned React.
        By March 2021, I embarked on my web developer career, sharpening my skills in WordPress and PHP.

        Alongside my technical skills, I've cultivated a positive attitude and continually seek to grow in my profession.</p>
